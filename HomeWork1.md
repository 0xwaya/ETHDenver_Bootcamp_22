Discuss in your teams what a decentralised version of a game like monopoly would be like, if there was no software on a central server.

Consider:

  * WHat are the essentials pieces of functionality?
  * How would people cheat?
  * How could you prevent them from cheating?

This is just a general discussion, there is no need to write any code or do any detailed design.

     Governance by a DAO /Smart Contract to assure transparency

     * Decentralized cloud hosting like; AREWEAVE 
     * Digital ID to sign in Such as Unstoppable domains
     * on chain trasactions on public ledger for every realstate purchases/sales
     * randomness to assure fairness in each player move, such as VRF from a decentralised oracle like witnet.
