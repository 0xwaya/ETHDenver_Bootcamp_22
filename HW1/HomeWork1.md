Discuss in your teams what a decentralised version of a game like monopoly would be like, if there was no software on a central server.

Consider:

  * What are the essential pieces of functionality?
  * How would people cheat?
  * How could you prevent them from cheating?

This is just a general discussion, there is no need to write any code or do any detailed design.





ANSWER:


  Essential pieces for a decentralised Monopoly game:
  
     Governance by a DAO /Smart Contract to assure transparency
     
  
     * Distributed nodes with consensus algos
     * Decentralized cloud hosting like; ARWEAVE 
     * Digital ID to sign in Such as Unstoppable Domains
     * on chain transactions in public ledger for every real estate purchases/sales
     * randomness to assure fairness in each player move, such as VRF from a decentralised oracle like witnet.
     
     
     
     How would people cheat?
     
     * Perhaps with multiple users for a single player to assure purchasing power
     * 
     *
     *
     *
     
     
     
     
     
     How to prevent them from cheating?
     
     * Whitelisting thru a verified POAP
     * Unstoppable domains verified NFT
     *
     *
     *
     

Marcos aproach ... "This is just a general discussion, there is no need to write any code or do any detailed design." then not so fast.... just conceptual thinking. not an implementation propose

functionality :  layers 

* DSW “dynamic shared world” (everything who changes during the game and everyone sees at same time). Ex the list of gamers and his attributes (cartesian posicion, value of attributes, etc…)
* SSW “Static shared world” (the static building blocks)
* LOG - all events who change the DSW.
* Rules (business) layer. Code acting over events (transactions)
* Random : to give a chance 

How would people cheat/ prevent them from cheating ? 
IRL people cheat when anyone is not watching. Then if we assegure everybody 
could  audit events, seeing what is happening maybe we prevent cheating.
